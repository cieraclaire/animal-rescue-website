    <p class="rescue-text island-1-4 milli">Meet Ollie, a pureâ€“bred ray of sunshine who has been with our Oxford Family for 6 months. He has been our saving grace here at the Rescue. He is considered a therapy dog, with proper documentation, and keeps a smile on every person's face that walks in. He immediately greets you at the door with his paw along with some sweet kisses. Ollie is alert and obedient, while also being playful and caring.</p>
